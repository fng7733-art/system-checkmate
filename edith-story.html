Edith — The Protector

Edith is the smallest one.

Youngest too.

If you just look at her, you wouldn’t think much of it.

Tiny.

Quiet.

Soft steps.

Almost invisible sometimes.

Her fur is so black that at night she disappears into the shadows.

Sometimes I search the whole house and realize she’s been right there the entire time, watching.

But somehow…

she’s the leader.

Not because she fights.

Not because she’s loud.

Because she’s calm.

When Edith walks into a room, everything settles.

If someone is scared, she sits beside them.

If someone hides, she stays close.

If there’s tension, she just watches quietly until it fades.

Like she absorbs the fear.

Like a tiny guardian spirit.

I’ve studied them for years now.

Cats have their own society.

And Edith is the one they trust.

Not me.

Her.

When Mister first came here, he was terrified of everything.

Especially me.

For six months he wouldn’t let me get close.

But Edith?

She stayed with him.

Every day.

Sleeping near him.

Walking beside him.

Showing him it was safe.

She took care of him long before he trusted me.

Like she was saying:

“I’ll check first. If it’s safe, you can come too.”

That’s who she is.

She protects the group before herself.

Always.

At night she often sits near my keyboard while I work.

Just watching the screens.

Green light reflecting in her eyes.

Quiet.

Focused.

Like a little commander monitoring the system.

That’s when I started calling her that.

Commander Edith.

Because it feels like she’s on duty.

Guarding the house.

Guarding us.

Making sure everything is okay.

The thing that hurts the most is how people treat her.

Some people here hate black cats.

Old superstitions. Stupid ideas.

They scare her when she goes outside.

Sometimes they try to chase her away.

Like she’s bad luck.

Like she doesn’t belong.

It makes me so angry I can’t even explain it.

Because they don’t see what I see.

They don’t see the gentlest soul in this house.

They don’t see the one who keeps everyone together.

They don’t see the protector.

They just see a color.

Idiots.

But here, inside this house, she’s safe.

Here she has her spots.

The lava lamp.

The window.

The warm chair.

The desk near the computer.

She moves quietly between us like a small shadow, checking on everyone.

Making sure the group is okay.

Making sure we’re all still here.

And somehow…

when Edith is in the room…

everything feels a little more stable.

Like nothing bad can happen.

Like the system is running exactly how it should.

She may be the smallest.

But she’s the strongest one of all.

Not with claws.

Not with speed.

With heart.

And honestly?

I think we’d all fall apart without her.

Me included.
