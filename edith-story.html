  <h1>&gt; Edith — The Protector</h1>

  <div class="story">
Edith is the smallest one.

Youngest too.

If you just look at her, you wouldn’t think much of it.

Tiny.
Quiet.
Soft steps.

Almost invisible sometimes.

Her fur is so black that at night she disappears into the shadows.

Sometimes I search the whole house and realize she’s been right there the entire time, watching.

But somehow…

she’s the leader.

Not because she fights.
Not because she’s loud.

Because she’s calm.

When Edith walks into a room, everything settles.

If someone is scared, she sits beside them.
If someone hides, she stays close.
If there’s tension, she just watches quietly until it fades.

Like she absorbs the fear.

Like a tiny guardian spirit.

Cats have their own society.

And Edith is the one they trust.

Not me.

Her.

When Mister first came here, he was terrified of everything.

But Edith stayed with him.

Every day.

Sleeping near him.
Walking beside him.
Showing him it was safe.

Like she was saying:

“I’ll check first. If it’s safe, you can come too.”

That’s who she is.

She protects the group before herself.

Always.

At night she sits near my keyboard while I work.

Green light reflecting in her eyes.

Quiet.
Focused.

Like a little commander monitoring the system.

Commander Edith.

Guarding the house.
Guarding us.

Making sure everything is okay.

People see a black cat.

I see the gentlest soul in this house.

The one who keeps everyone together.

The protector.

And honestly?

I think we’d all fall apart without her.

Me included.
