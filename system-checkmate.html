SYSTEM_CHECKMATE v2.3
initializing rescue protocols...
compassion: enabled
shield_wall: online
mode: underground


We are not a company.
We are not a brand.
We are not a business.

We are a small house
full of old computers,
warm lamps,
and rescued cats.


Outside:
noise
greed
war
people hurting each other

Inside:
food
warmth
safety
quiet


Three cats came from hell.

21 cats in one broken house.
No food.
No care.
Only survival.

They weren’t pets.
They were refugees.


So we made a rule:

If you're small → we protect you
If you're hungry → we feed you
If you're scared → you stay
No one gets left behind


We sell art.
We build weird machines.
We run ancient hardware.
We code at night.
We do whatever works.

Everything goes to the cats.

Always.


This isn’t charity.
This is duty.


system_checkmate: running
scan: suffering
target: local
strategy: help_the_one_in_front_of_you


Because maybe you don’t save the world at once.

Maybe you just save
one life
at a time.
