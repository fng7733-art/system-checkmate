Mister — The One Who Learned To Trust


He didn’t come to me like Edith did.

He didn’t choose the house.

He didn’t walk inside like he belonged.

He arrived scared.


Not careful.

Not shy.

Scared.


The kind of scared that lives deep in the bones.


Every sound made him jump.

Every movement made him run.

Every time I walked into the room —

he disappeared.


Under the bed.

Behind the couch.

Anywhere I wasn’t.


For six months…

I barely touched him.


Six months in the same apartment
with a cat who acted like I was the monster.


Food?

Only when I left the room.

Water?

When it was quiet.

Eye contact?

Never.


If I looked at him, he froze.

Like prey.


It hurt more than I expected.

Because you start to wonder:

“Did I do something wrong?”

“Why does he hate me?”


But he didn’t hate me.

He just didn’t trust the world.


And honestly…

I don’t blame him.


You don’t get that scared for no reason.


Then Edith stepped in.


Not me.


Her.


She slept near him.

Walked beside him.

Ate next to him.

Like she was teaching him:

“See? Nothing bad happens here.”


She checked the world for him first.


Slowly…

he started staying in the same room.


Then a little closer.


Then one day —

he didn’t run when I walked past.


Just watched.


That was progress.


Weeks later…

he let me sit beside him.


Months later…

I touched his head for the first time.


Just one finger.


He didn’t move.


I swear that tiny moment felt bigger than anything.


Trust isn’t loud.

It’s quiet.

Tiny.

Fragile.


But when it happens —

it’s everything.


Now?


Now he sleeps under my blanket every night.


Right against my legs.

Like I’m the safe place.


Sometimes I wake up and he’s pressed into me,
completely relaxed,
belly exposed,
dreaming.


You don’t fake that.


That’s pure trust.


The cat that once ran from my shadow
now follows me from room to room.


Not because he has to.


Because he wants to.


That’s not rescue.


That’s earned.


And honestly?

Watching Mister learn that the world isn’t always dangerous…

might be the bravest thing I’ve ever seen.
