Mister — The One Who Learned to Trust

We’re four in this house.

Just four.

Me, Mister, Edith, and Chili.

A small place filled with old tech, cables, screens, and fans humming all night. Nothing fancy. Just old computers, wires everywhere, keyboards, warm lamps, and second-hand gear.

From the outside it probably looks messy.

But inside, it’s calm.

Safe.

Ours.

Right now Chili is in the bedroom window watching the world outside. Edith is probably near the lava lamp, one of her favorite spots. And Mister is under the blanket beside me, moving around like a tiny submarine.

That’s how he sleeps.

As close as possible.

Always touching.

Always near.

But it wasn’t always like this.

When Mister first came here, he didn’t trust me at all.

If I stood up, he ran.
If I walked into the room, he disappeared.
If I reached out my hand, he hid.

For six months.

He lived in my house like I was the enemy.

I never forced him. No grabbing. No chasing. No “come here.”

Just food. Water. Quiet. Patience.

That’s it.

Edith helped him before I ever could.

She’s the smallest one. The youngest too. But somehow she’s the leader.

She doesn’t fight.
She doesn’t make noise.
She just keeps everyone calm.

If someone is scared, she sits beside them. If Mister hides, she stays with him. Like a tiny black guardian.

She protected him until he felt safe.

Then one night, something changed.

I was sitting at the computer like always, screens glowing, fans humming.

And suddenly something touched my hand.

Soft. Warm.

Mister.

He didn’t run.

He pressed his head into my palm like he had made a decision.

Like he was saying, “Okay… you’re safe.”

I’ll never forget that moment.

Trust like that isn’t taken. It’s given.

And when it happens, it feels huge.

Now he follows me everywhere.

Sleeps beside me. Crawls under blankets while I work. If I change rooms, he shows up a few minutes later like my little shadow.

He’s not scared anymore.

He’s my best friend.

People might not understand this life. From the outside it looks small. Old tech. Old furniture. Just us trying to survive.

But at night, when everything is quiet and the four of us are together, it feels like the safest place in the world.

It’s not much.

But it’s ours.

And honestly, it’s enough.
