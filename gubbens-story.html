Lilla Gubben — The Winter Ghost

He wasn’t supposed to be here.

He just appeared.

One cold day.
At my door.

Like he had already decided something.

Like:

“yeah… this place will do.”

Nobody knew where he came from.

No collar.
No name.
No history.

Just a gray shape in the snow.

Half wolf.
Half shadow.

People were afraid of him.

Said he looked wild.

Maybe he was.

But not with me.

With me he was soft.

He didn’t want to stay inside much.

Winter was his element.

Cold air.
Silent nights.
Snow under his paws.

He’d go out for hours.

Then come back like nothing happened.

Eat.

Sleep.

Leave again.

Like a visitor between two worlds.

Not owned.

Just… choosing.

He loved shrimps.

Went crazy for them.

Played like a kitten.

Attacked my hands on the couch.

Rolled around like a fool.

Then five minutes later—

out cold on the bed, belly up, completely safe.

That’s trust.

You don’t sleep like that unless you feel home.

People laughed at his name.

“Lilla Gubben?”

They didn’t get it.

He looked like a wolf.

But he was gentle.

Smaller than me.

So he became

Little Old Man.

My little old man.

I even got insurance for him.

That’s how real he was to me.

Family.

Not “just a cat.”

Family.

He stayed the whole winter.

Like a seasonal guardian.

Like something borrowed.

And then one day—

he didn’t come back.

No goodbye.

No sound.

Just gone.

Like fog lifting.

Some cats you rescue.

Some cats rescue you.

Some just pass through your life

to warm it for a while.

I think he was one of those.

Not lost.

Just roaming somewhere else now.

Still wild.

Still free.

Still my cat.
